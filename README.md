# Computer Vision Course


Welcome to our repository containing solutions to seven homework assignments as part of our Computer Vision course. Each assignment focuses on a different aspect of computer vision, applying techniques learned during our course.

The objective of this repository is to provide a hands-on approach to understanding various computer vision algorithms and techniques. Each report contains an explanation of the methodology used, along with the implementation of the respective algorithms.

## Contents

Here is a brief description of the homework assignments contained in this repository:


### Homework 1: Connected Component Labeling

This assignment focuses on identifying and labeling individual connected regions in a given binary image using a group of neighboring pixels.

### Homework 2: Morphological Image Processing
Here, we delve into morphological image processing techniques including erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and boundary extraction.

### Homework 3: Histogram Equalization
The third assignment involves the implementation of histogram equalization to enhance the contrast of an image by redistributing its intensity values.

### Homework 4: Skin Color Detection
This homework covers detecting skin color pixels in hand images using a histogram-based technique.

### Homework 5: Canny Edge Detection
The fifth assignment involves the implementation of the Canny edge detection technique to accurately identify and locate sharp edges in an image.

### Homework 6: Hough Transform Line Detection
In this assignment, we implement the Hough transform technique to detect lines in images by creating a parameter space representing all possible lines in an image.

### Homework 7: Template Matching Based Target Tracking
The final assignment involves the implementation of a template-matching based technique for tracking the head of a girl over a sequence of 500 frames.
## Getting Started

Each folder in this repository represents a homework assignment. Inside each folder, you will find a detailed report outlining the approach, results, and any relevant conclusions.

Also included within each folder is the Python code used to complete the assignment. If you would like to run the code yourself, make sure you have the required libraries installed on your machine.
